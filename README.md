Learning python seriously and in dept in 2022,to be used mainly for data science.
P.S: python as my fourth language after PHP, javascript and golang, in that order, needless to say, the codes in here may not be beginner friendly, and some things will surely be skipped.But python is high level enough for most people to understand
P.S: this is also where i just practice random python codes
