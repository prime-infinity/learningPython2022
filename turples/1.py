# right off the bat, turples are simply immutabel arrays/lists
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
print(numbers)
# numbers[1] = 3 #note: this will not work as they cannot be mutated

# turple methods
numbers.count(1)  # return the number of occurence of an element

numbers.index(2)
# return the index position of the first occurence of an element
